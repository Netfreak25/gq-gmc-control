Installation instructions
=========================

Dependencies
------------

- python 2.7
- pyserial


Linux installations
-------------------
Debian based system should use the apt package manager to install dependencies:

$ sudo apt-get install python-serial


Windows installations
---------------------
Windows based systems should install the individual components separately:

* python 2.7
https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/

* pyserial
pip install pyserial

* USB CDC driver
It's possibly needed to install an USB CDC driver as well


OS X installations
------------------
Not tested, but should be possible. The Windows based install instructions
should work here too.
